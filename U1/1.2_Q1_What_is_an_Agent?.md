Q1: What is an Agent?
Which of the following best describes an AI Agent?

 An AI model that can reason, plan, and use tools to interact with its environment to achieve a specific goal.
Correct! This definition captures the essential characteristics of an Agent.
 A system that solely processes static text, without any inherent mechanism to interact dynamically with its surroundings or execute meaningful actions.
 A conversational agent restricted to answering queries, lacking the ability to perform any actions or interact with external systems.
 An online repository of information that offers static content without the capability to execute tasks or interact actively with users.

Q2: What is the Role of Planning in an Agent?
Why does an Agent need to plan before taking an action?

 To primarily store or recall past interactions, rather than mapping out a sequence of future actions.
 To decide on the sequence of actions and select appropriate tools needed to fulfill the user’s request.
Correct! Planning helps the Agent determine the best steps and tools to complete a task.
 To execute a sequence of arbitrary and uncoordinated actions that lack any defined strategy or intentional objective.
 To merely convert or translate text, bypassing any process of formulating a deliberate sequence of actions or employing strategic reasoning.

Q3: How Do Tools Enhance an Agent’s Capabilities?
Why are tools essential for an Agent?

 Tools serve no real purpose and do not contribute to the Agent’s ability to perform actions beyond basic text generation.
 Tools are solely designed for memory storage, lacking any capacity to facilitate the execution of tasks or enhance interactive performance.
 Tools severely restrict the Agent exclusively to generating text, thereby preventing it from engaging in a broader range of interactive actions.
 Tools provide the Agent with the ability to execute actions a text-generation model cannot perform natively, such as making coffee or generating images.
Correct! Tools enable Agents to interact with the real world and complete tasks.

Q4: How Do Actions Differ from Tools?
What is the key difference between Actions and Tools?

 Actions are the steps the Agent takes, while Tools are external resources the Agent can use to perform those actions.
Correct! Actions are higher-level objectives, while Tools are specific functions the Agent can call upon.
 Actions and Tools are entirely identical components that can be used interchangeably, with no clear differences between them.
 Tools are considered broad utilities available for various functions, whereas Actions are mistakenly thought to be restricted only to physical interactions.
 Actions inherently require the use of LLMs to be determined and executed, whereas Tools are designed to function autonomously without such dependencies.

Q5: What Role Do Large Language Models (LLMs) Play in Agents?
How do LLMs contribute to an Agent’s functionality?

 LLMs function merely as passive repositories that store information, lacking any capability to actively process input or produce dynamic responses.
 LLMs serve as the reasoning 'brain' of the Agent, processing text inputs to understand instructions and plan actions.
Correct! LLMs enable the Agent to interpret, plan, and decide on the next steps.
 LLMs are erroneously believed to be used solely for image processing, when in fact their primary function is to process and generate text.
 LLMs are considered completely irrelevant to the operation of AI Agents, implying that they are entirely superfluous in any practical application.

Q6: Which of the Following Best Demonstrates an AI Agent?
Which real-world example best illustrates an AI Agent at work?

 A static FAQ page on a website that provides fixed information and lacks any interactive or dynamic response capabilities.
 A simple calculator that performs arithmetic operations based on fixed rules, without any capability for reasoning or planning.
 A virtual assistant like Siri or Alexa that can understand spoken commands, reason through them, and perform tasks like setting reminders or sending messages.
Correct! This example includes reasoning, planning, and interaction with the environment.
 A video game NPC that operates on a fixed script of responses, without the ability to reason, plan, or use external tools.
